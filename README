= Radiant Form Extension

This extension allows a developer to create forms which are reusable as well as hookable.

The idea was taken from the mailer extension, everything mail specific was ripped out and put in
  http://github.com/squaretalent/radiant-mail-extension
  
Using forms drys up the process of creating and reusing forms across a site (well we think so at least).

== Installation

  git clone git://github.com/squaretalent/radiant-form-extension vendor/extensions/form
  rake radiant:extensions:form:migrate
  #there are no assets to update at the moment.

== Usage
  
  A new tab will be present under design, a form has the following properties

    title = reference for when you call the form tag (no spaces)
    body = output which will be shown on a radiant page
    content = presentation of data after form is submitted (useful when sending emails)
    config = configuration for form-addons
    
  Include the form in a page using a radius tag
    <r:form name="my-cool-form" />
